                It was 3 am, Colin had gotten up to attend nature &#x27;s call. After so many sleepless nights, as he
                counted on his fingers, that was the night he finally had some sleep. He was clean now and finally
                making amends to the fact that he was not the reason behind his daughter’s death by drowning. Amy’s
                death was an accident. 4 weeks ago, he wouldn &#x27;t have believed that he would be able to move ahead
                after the divorce. His toxicity was the reason behind it. &#x27;Now i have hope, now I have the will to
                live.&#x27;he reinstated standing in the balcony as he finished his last bit of cigarette. He yearned
                sleep today.<br />
                <br />
                As he entered the room and shut the lights his phone beeped. “A notification at this time, must be from
                the operator regarding tomorrow &#x27;s due date”, he thought ignoring it. He jumped on his bed, rubbing
                his eyes ready to sleep again. He was half-asleep half-awake by this time, moving an inch closer to
                snores with every other breath .The phone beeped again, he woke up with a shriek to buzz it off; for his
                sound sleep was now his first priority.<br />
                <br />
                Just as he tapped his phone he saw the notification &#x27;KINDLY NOTE, THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU CAN WAKE
                UP AGAIN HAS DROPPED TO ZERO’. This was weird. Must be some kind of prank he thought. He dialled the
                number, and the bot repeated &#x27;KINDLY NOTE, THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU CAN WAKE UP AGAIN HAS DROPPED TO
                ZERO’. Ironically his sleep vanished. Colin copied the message and went onto a Google search streak, too
                damn sure, of it being a prank by some nocturnal who’s too high to sleep.<br />
                <br />
                He received the same voice note as he tapped the search icon. He kept trying, waiting for a sane result
                to show up but all he saw was &#x27;NO SEARCH RESULTS’. All this while his phone kept buzzing. His inbox
                was flooded. <br />
                <br />
                The clock struck 6. His eyes had turned red and he reminded himself &#x27;I shouldn &#x27;t sleep at any
                cost &#x27;after cleaning his inbox. He reached his office and was greeted by his colleagues as usual.
                His phone kept buzzing with the same notification hour after hour. <br />
                <br />
                He crept here and there to see if anybody was watching him over. After his daughter &#x27;s death all he
                did was kept to himself. He had lost contacts with friends and family. Colin had become a loner. As he
                pondered, a thought struck him &#x27;Maybe the time to meet Amy has come. Maybe this was the way to get
                to the end.’ His suicidal thoughts were resurging. ‘Suicide by insomnia it is &#x27;. It was a reason he
                made up just to hush his thoughts of the will to live. But there was a part of him who wanted to live,
                who had moved on. Colin was in a dilemma but he had become too weak to acknowledge it.<br />
                ‍<br />
                As he kept himself awake he completed all deadlines and decided to stop his visits to the therapist. He
                was determined to not sleep at any cost. As days went by he made it a short routine to recherish
                memories by revisiting the places he took Amy to. For Colin sleep deprived him of life and life deprived
                him of sleep. With his insomnia and paranoia his addiction to drugs was recurring back. With the triumph
                of his hysteria on him, Colin decided to shut himself from everyone completely to the extent that he
                bought stash of drugs to keep him up on his toes till the day comes. Before this he thought of paying a
                visit to his ex-wife Daisy and bid her a goodbye. Seeing him in this state she said ‘You started it
                again didn &#x27;t you!! Get out of here!’ and shut the door on his face.<br />
                <br />
                As days went by, he became comfortably numb so much so that he had lost count of the days he had spent
                in the storeroom with Amy &#x27;s things! All Colin could hear was murmurs of some sorts. ‘D..D..D..ad’.
                As he snort the last bit of his pack he fell on the bed with a thud. His snores turned into silence as
                he slept the last time in solace. <br />
                It was time to WAKE UP.!<br />
                <br />
